## steering behaviours [boids]

follow-the-leader

wall following

a seek behaviour that avoids overshooting (arrive)

separation, cohesion and alignment


## pathfinding

correctly calculates the shortest path to the target 

smoothed 

Pathfinding is integrated with steering（via forces/acceleration）（via forces/acceleration）

periodically updating the path

world are associated with a higher path cost than others (e.g., swamp versus dry land).

## FSMs

At least two types of character use FSMs

## Game build

Graphics, animation and sound

collectable items / weapons

multiple types of prey or predator

procedurally generated levels
